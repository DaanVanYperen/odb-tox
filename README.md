#### Summary
7DRL entry made in 72 hours, strategic dungeon crawler!

#### Tech
Running on [LibGDX 1.5.3](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) and [Artemis-ODB 1.8.1](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb). 
Tested for desktop, html5 via gwt and android.

#### Grab what you need!
Artemis Entity System takes a way a lot of the lifecycle management, and composition is a natural match for a time constrained Jam. While made in a rush, I hope this code gives you an idea or two how to benefit from using an entity system in your project. This is based on an old version of Artemis so some of the constructs are deprecated.

#### Usage details
While the meat is with peeking at the systems and components, you might like to compile the game! The project was created using libgdx-setup (not libgdx-setup-ui), which uses gradle for build automation, and snapshot versions of artemis and libgdx. ```gradlew desktop:run``` should run the game. See the [libgdx wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki) for how to use gradle with your ide.

#### License summary

#### Play it!
It’s a brutal game, but the scenarios aren’t totally random, they just appear that way. There’s always a path of victory! Well, the first few levels at least. 
A good way to get started is fighting the weaker guys first. This levels you up which makes the tougher enemies weaker. 
Try to get a feel for the sweet spot for dosing yourself, don’t just pick it up whenever you can; when you level you gain hitpoints, drugs heal you up fully, 
so taking them later boosts your chance of survival.
Items are really valuable, they alter the gameplay in subtle ways. Be smart about the order you pick them up, and try to figure out what the special items do.
World changes are not just superficial! Keep an eye on what else changes!
